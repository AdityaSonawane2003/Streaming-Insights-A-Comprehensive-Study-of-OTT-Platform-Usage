# Streaming-Insights-A-Comprehensive-Study-of-OTT-Platform-Usage

# Project Overview

This project, **"Streaming Insights: A Comprehensive Study of OTT Platform Usage"**, is a detailed statistical analysis of consumer behavior on Over-the-Top (OTT) platforms.

The study examines user engagement patterns, preferences, and satisfaction levels across major OTT platforms like Netflix, Disney+ Hotstar, Amazon Prime Video, Sony Liv, and Jio Cinema.

# Objectives

-To compare various OTT platforms based on user viewership.

-To analyze OTT usage across different demographics (e.g., age, profession, income groups).

-To identify the most commonly viewed content categories.

-To evaluate subscription patterns and user renewal habits.

-To understand user perception of pricing and satisfaction.

-To apply statistical techniques for robust data analysis.

# Methodology

# 1. Data Collection

A structured survey was conducted with a sample size of 278 respondents.

Respondents provided information on demographics, OTT usage habits, and subscription patterns.

# 2. Data Analysis Techniques

**Graphical Representations:** Column charts, pie charts, and stacked column charts.

**Shapiro-Wilk Normality Test:** Used to check if the OTT usage data follows a normal distribution.

**Fitting of Exponential Distribution:** Modelled the time spent on OTT platforms.

**Chi-Square Tests:** Applied to evaluate the goodness of fit and independence of attributes.

**Population Proportion Test:** Compared subscription renewal rates across student and non-student groups.

**Machine Learning Algorithms:** Implemented Na√Øve Bayes Classifier and k-means clustering for advanced insights.

# Key Findings

-Most Popular OTT Platform: Disney+ Hotstar emerged as the most frequently used platform.

-Device Preference: Mobile phones are the preferred device for streaming across all platforms.

-Content Consumption: Users typically consume both Indian and International content, with a preference for movies and web series.

-Subscription Renewal: Approximately 41% of users renew their subscriptions regularly.

-User Satisfaction: Satisfaction levels vary based on pricing perceptions and content variety.

-Dependency Analysis: The Chi-square test revealed a significant dependency between OTT platform and content type.

# Tools & Technologies

**R Programming:** Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing.

**Python (Matplotlib, Pandas):** Data visualization and advanced analytics.

**Excel:** Data preprocessing and initial exploratory analysis.

# Future Scope

**Expand the sample size for better generalizability.**

**Apply deep learning techniques for more sophisticated pattern detection.**

**Integrate real-time OTT usage monitoring for dynamic analysis.**
